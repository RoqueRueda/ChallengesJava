Coding challenges resolved in java

## Getting Started

The following points are usefull when solving the challenges please take them into account:

### How to break down a problem

Not just code the problem try to follow the stepts

	1. Understand the problem (ask questions to yourself about each term and concept in the problem)
	2. Clarify what is not correct 
	3. The input constraints (double check the constraints of the problem)
	4. Think what are the test cases (try to create some sample input and what will be the result output)
	5. Solve the problem manually (solve the test cases you create in the previous step manually)
	6. Look for patterns
	7. Define the process to solve
		a. The process doesn't have a programming languaje
	8. Coding
		a. Put comments in natural language
		b. Pick a programming language
		c. Do magic
	9. Check for common cases for mistakes
		a. For loops
		b. If clauses
		c. Memory allocations
	10. Run the cases
		a. Check the code
		b. If you have an error try to spot errors and change the code when you are sure you have to
		c. Debug
